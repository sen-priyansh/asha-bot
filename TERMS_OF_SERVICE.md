# Terms of Service — Asha Discord Bot

Effective date: 2025-11-10

Note: This document provides general terms for a Discord bot. It is not legal advice. You should review and customize it (e.g., governing law, contact details) and consult a lawyer if you operate at scale or handle regulated data.

## 1. Agreement to Terms
By adding, using, or interacting with the Asha Discord Bot ("Bot", "Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree, do not use the Service.

You also agree to comply with all applicable laws and Discord’s Terms of Service, Community Guidelines, and Developer Policies.

## 2. Description of the Service
The Bot provides moderation tools, leveling and reaction roles, utility commands, and optional AI chat (powered by Google’s Gemini). Features may change over time.

## 3. Eligibility and Age
You must meet Discord’s minimum age requirements (typically 13+, or higher where applicable by local law). Server administrators are responsible for ensuring their communities comply with relevant age and content standards.

## 4. Access and Permissions
- The Bot operates through Discord guilds (servers). It requires certain permissions (e.g., Manage Roles, Send Messages, Read Message History, Add Reactions) to function.
- Granting the Bot permissions authorizes it to perform those actions on your server.
- Server administrators are responsible for configuring permissions appropriately.

## 5. Acceptable Use
You may not use the Service to:
- Violate any laws or regulations, infringe intellectual property, or encourage illegal activity.
- Harass, abuse, or harm others; disseminate hateful or adult content; or promote violence.
- Spam, flood, or attempt to disrupt the Service or Discord.
- Circumvent moderation or perform actions beyond your authorization.
- Probe, scan, or test the security of the Service without written permission.

The Bot may restrict functionality, remove data, or leave a server if it detects or is used for prohibited activities.

## 6. AI Features and Disclaimers
- AI responses are generated by third-party models (Google Generative AI / Gemini) and may be inaccurate, incomplete, or inappropriate. Use at your own risk.
- Do not rely on AI outputs for legal, medical, financial, or other professional advice.
- Do not input sensitive personal data or confidential information. You are responsible for what you submit.

## 7. Data and Privacy
What we process
- Discord-provided identifiers and metadata necessary to operate the Bot (e.g., user IDs, role IDs, channel IDs, message IDs).
- Server configuration data (e.g., reaction role mappings, leveling data) stored as JSON on the bot host.
- AI chat: message content you send for the purpose of generating responses. Chat sessions are kept in memory per user and are not written to disk by default. Admins/users can reset chat history with commands (e.g., `/resetchat`).

What we do not do
- We do not sell your data.
- We do not store your Discord token or API keys in code; they are supplied via environment variables.

Third parties
- AI requests are sent to Google Generative AI. Use of AI features is subject to Google’s terms and privacy practices.

Retention & deletion
- Configuration JSON files (e.g., leveling or reaction roles) persist on the bot host while the Bot is active in your server.
- Removing the Bot from a server may orphan related data; contact the Bot owner if you need data removal.
- Users may request deletion of their AI chat session using `/resetchat`.

For details, see the project’s README and consider adding a dedicated Privacy Policy if you need one.

## 8. Moderation Tools
When enabled, moderation commands (warnings, mutes, kicks, bans, purges) can affect members. Server administrators are responsible for lawful, transparent, and consistent moderation practices.

## 9. Availability and Changes
- The Service is provided on a best-effort basis. We do not guarantee uptime, latency, or particular outcomes.
- Features may change, be limited, or be discontinued at any time without notice.
- We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use after changes means you accept the updated Terms.

## 10. Intellectual Property
The Bot software is licensed as stated in the repository (e.g., MIT). These Terms do not grant you rights to use the name, logos, or brand assets except as necessary to use the Service.

## 11. Warranty Disclaimer
THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE,” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. USE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK.

## 12. Limitation of Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE BOT OWNERS, CONTRIBUTORS, AND MAINTAINERS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, PROFITS, OR REVENUE, ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE.

## 13. Indemnification
You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Bot owners and contributors from any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from your use of the Service, your violation of these Terms, or your violation of any third-party rights.

## 14. Governing Law and Venue
These Terms will be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where the Bot owner resides, without regard to conflict of laws principles. You agree to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts located in that jurisdiction.

## 15. Termination
We may suspend or terminate access to the Service at any time, including if you violate these Terms. Server administrators may remove the Bot from their servers at any time.

## 16. Contact
For questions or requests (e.g., data deletion for configuration files), contact the Bot owner/maintainer listed in the repository or open an issue on the project’s GitHub.
